This application (full django app) makes my life of managing paloalto firewalls through panorama easier.
once you teach it your network (and see the readme.txt file on how to teach it..) it can build you firewall rules with redundancy in mind. 
it can also disect your logs for your end users. I've reduced 90% of the 'its the network' tickets at work by teaching my end users on how to run through a simple search. 
it can currently build you VPN networks, however its a bit broken in the flow. I'm working on adding more / better documentation and flow there.
it can in theory do some simple vlan work, although i've removed the plays the code itself is there. the plays were specific to arista... 

the idea here is that mohan will write you the var files (YAML) needed to run Ansible playbooks to do specific things in your network. 
although i have heavily tied it into panorama with checking URLs, objects, services and schedules... nothing says you can't write some code to cover other NGFW managment modules / plays.
